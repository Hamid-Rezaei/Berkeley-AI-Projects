# AI Project Spring 2023: The Pac-Man Projects

## Overview
The [Pac-Man Projects, developed at UC Berkeley](http://ai.berkeley.edu), aims to advance the field of artificial intelligence through the development and evaluation of intelligent agents in the context of the Pacman game. It serves as a playground for exploring different AI algorithms, including search algorithms, adversarial search, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic inference.

## Each Project Aim

- ### 1-Search
   Implement and evaluate search algorithms to enable Pacman agents to navigate the game maze effectively. This includes depth-first search, breadth-first search, uniform-cost search, and A* search.
- ### 2-MultiAgent
   Develop intelligent agents that can compete against ghosts using adversarial search algorithms. Minimax and alpha-beta pruning techniques allow agents to make optimal decisions in a competitive environment.
- ### 3-ReinforcementLearning
   Employ Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning techniques, such as Value Iteration, Q-learning, and Approximate Q-learning, to enable Pacman agents to learn and improve their performance over time. Agents can adapt and make optimal decisions by maximizing cumulative rewards.
- ### 4-GhustBusters
   Utilize probabilistic models, such as Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov Models, to reason under uncertainty and make informed decisions in complex situations.
